# Binder Workflow

Binder is a good demo environment for students to interact with Jupyter notebooks. It creates a standardized computing environment in the cloud. To practice version control, you'll need extra steps to bring your changes from the cloud to your local computer.

Programs you have:
* Terminal
* GitHub
    * You have successfully forked the `simple-coronavirus-report` and made it your own

Programs you don't have:
* Docker 

## Workflow with GitHub

1. ...MAKE ALL YOUR CHANGES...
1. Launch a Terminal
1. Type: `git status` to see which files you've made changes to
1. For every file you want to include in your commit: right click > download
1. Move those downloaded files into your local GitHub repo
1. In Ubuntu: `git status` to check that all those files are there, ready to be staged
1. Follow the [GitHub workflow](./github_version_control.md) of pushing changes to the remote using `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`
